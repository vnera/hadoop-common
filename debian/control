Description: A software platform for processing vast amounts of data
 Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and
 run applications that process vast amounts of data.
 .
 Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful:
  * Scalable: Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.
  * Economical: It distributes the data and processing across clusters
                of commonly available computers. These clusters can number
                into the thousands of nodes.
  * Efficient: By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel
               on the nodes where the data is located. This makes it
               extremely rapid.
  * Reliable: Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and
              automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.
 .
 Hadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
 MapReduce divides applications into many small blocks of work. HDFS creates
 multiple replicas of data blocks for reliability, placing them on compute
 nodes around the cluster. MapReduce can then process the data where it is
 located.

Description: The Hadoop Distributed File System
 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the primary storage system used by
 Hadoop applications. HDFS creates multiple replicas of data blocks and
 distributes them on cluster hosts to enable reliable and extremely rapid
 computations.

Package: hadoop-yarn
Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, adduser, bigtop-utils (>= 0.7), hadoop (= ${source:Version}), avro-libs, zookeeper
Description: The Hadoop NextGen MapReduce (YARN)
 YARN (Hadoop NextGen MapReduce) is a general purpose data-computation framework.
 YARN splits up the functionalities of JobTracker, resource management, 
 job scheduling, and job monitoring into separate daemons called 
 ResourceManager and NodeManager.
 .
 ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources 
 among all applications in the system. NodeManager is a per-host worker
 that manages allocation of computational resources on a single host. 
 Both daemons work in support of ApplicationMaster (AM).
 .
 ApplicationMaster is a framework-specific library that negotiates resources 
 from ResourceManager and works with NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor 
 the tasks.

Description: HDFS exposed over a Filesystem in Userspace
 These projects (enumerated below) allow HDFS to be mounted (on most flavors 
 of Unix) as a standard file system using the mount command. Once mounted, the
  user can operate on an instance of hdfs using standard Unix utilities such 
 as 'ls', 'cd', 'cp', 'mkdir', 'find', 'grep', or use standard Posix libraries 
 like open, write, read, close from C, C++, Python, Ruby, Perl, Java, bash, etc.
